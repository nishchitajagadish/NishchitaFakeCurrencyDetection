# FakeCurrencyDetection-Project
AI-powered solution to detect counterfeit Indian rupee notes using computer vision and deep learning.

---

## Overview
This project provides a practical tool for detecting counterfeit Indian currency using a combination of traditional image processing and modern deep learning frameworks. Built with **Python 3, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras**, it extracts key visual features from banknotes to distinguish between genuine and fake notes.

---

## Motivation
India’s economy relies heavily on cash transactions, making the circulation of fake notes a serious concern—especially in areas where rigorous checks are not always feasible.  
The goal of this project is to empower small vendors, retailers, and everyday users with a quick, accessible method to verify currency authenticity using just a smartphone or webcam.
